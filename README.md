Guy's Teaching Tools, a collection of simple interactive Java apps, each with the aim of helping students understand a different concept in math and science. The suite was developed by my grandfather, Guy Lemire of Deep River, Ontario © 2000. 

Each program is a unique Java file with the UI done with JFrame. Find in the repository the original, unedited code which (despite not having been updated in ~20 years) still works like a charm. He has kindly consented to releasing the source code under the MIT licence. Please enjoy!

# TrigTutor

Helps students develop a more intuitive understanding of the relationship of angles, sin/cos/tan functions, and radians. The user may select an angle by clicking and draging the red ball, adjusting the slider at the bottom, or specify a degree in the text field at the bottom. All other values (as well as the angle displayed) automatically update to reflect the current position.

# Parabola

The application presents a parabola of x²=4py. The user is able to modify the shape and direction of the parabola, as well as play with selecting a point along the curve to see how the tangeant changes with that points position on the parabola. A "reflector" mode is available in the second image bellow to show how various angles of a beam would be reflected in the shape, the focal point is modifiable, the program will change the parabola's shape to reflect it. (more details on practical applications of parabolas by pressing the "applications" button)

# Circle

Relates several mathematical properties of a circle to one another.

# PowerSupply

A simple representation of a 120V AC to 12V DC power transformer. On/off button toggles animations in red across the line at the bottom, which correlate to the amplitude of voltage (note only positive values after the diode rectifier) as a visual aid.

# TriangleDemo

Much like TrigTutor, TriangleDemo presents a modifiable triangle and displays the correlating side lengths, area, and angles. By clicking and dragging any of the three red dots, the triangle changes form and the values update to reflect its changing shape.
