# TrigTutor

A simple Java app to help students develop a more intuitive understanding of the relationship of angles, sin/cos/tan functions, and radians. The user may select an angle by clicking and draging the red ball, adjusting the slider at the bottom, or specify a degree in the text field at the bottom. All other values (as well as the angle displayed) automatically update to reflect the current position.  Developed by Guy Lemire of Deep River, Ontario Â© 2000.
